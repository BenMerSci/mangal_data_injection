# mangal_data_injection

Experimenting how to upload my data to Mangal.

Data in `data/` contains:  

a) `CapCreusNtw.csv` with data from Bartomeus et al 2008. Lat Long of sites can be added. Maybe independent flower counts can be added.

b) All other files contain data from Magrach et al 2020. SOme metadata will be useful to interpret the data.
