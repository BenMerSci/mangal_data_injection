# R Guidelines / Template for Mangal data injection
# More information on Mangal and API Endpoints at https://mangal.io and https://mangal.io/doc/api/
# This guideline is an aggregation of different script parts coming from different people at the Mangal project.
# Author of this guideline : Benjamin Mercier
# Date : August 2020

# All caps field must be filled, null fields are optional.
# Use one formatting/injection script per dataset. A dataset can contain multiple networks/sites.

# Interaction
# If there is multiple network, separate the interaction data_frame by networks/sites into a list. 
# The interaction "matrices" have to be long format (NO ADJACENCY MATRICES):
# First column is named "sp_taxon_1" (making the interaction), second column is named "sp_taxon_2" (receiving the interaction) and third column named "value" is the interaction value.
# Interaction value is either 1/0 if it's Presence/Absence, or a whole/real positive number if it's a frequency or relative diet.

# All the informations in the list below can vary between each interaction in the network. If they don't vary, just fill once the list below.
# If they vary, they can be "manually" added as a column to the LONG FORMAT interaction matrix.
# For example, in the same network, we could have predators eating their prey (type = "predation") and herbivores grazing on plants (type = "herbivory")
# This way, we "cbind" a column named "type", and on each line where we have predation, the value of the column "type" will be "predation". (Same logic for the herbivory)
# If an argument varies in a network, remove it from the list below. (Because in the injection process, each argument is cbinded to the long format interaction matrix)

interaction <- list(date          = "YEAR-MONTH-DAY", # Date of the recorded interactions

# Node
# (Might be a weird table to make if the taxonomy is already well resolved, but we need it because sometimes in the original interaction matrices there are names like : Canis sp. so we want to link Canis sp. to only the genus "Canis" in the Taxonomy table.)
# Same as the interaction data, separate each nodes (taxon) by networks/sites into a list.
# We need a data_frame with two columns:
# First column (original_name): Names that were originally used in the interaction matrix, might be common name
# Second column (clear_name): Names that were taxonomically resolved i.e.: no "sp.", no whitespaces etc.
# To get the name resolved (if they aren't already) I used to use taxize::gnr_resolve()
